Program requirements: 1. The program should take either ﬁlenames or wildcards (* for example) as input. 2. Create as many child processes as there are ﬁles on the command line. Child processes should run simultaneously, not wait on each other. There are MANY ways that your code may be limited to sequential processing. To test for parallel code, make your child process wait for 1 second. If you have n ﬁles and your program is delayed 1 second, your code is parallel. If it is delayed n seconds, it is not parallel. 3. For each child process, print the ﬁle name and the process ID of the child process 4. The parent process should wait for all the children to ﬁnish then show the output from: system(“ps -H”); This statement placed in other locations of your program may be a helpful command to debug your code.
